I.	East African Breweries Limited (EABL)
•	Disciplined Investment: Through the improvement of its brewing plant, and increasing its production capacity, EABL has been in a position to be able to supply the increasing demand of its products in East Africa region.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
II.	Safaricom 
•	Disciplined Investment: An illustration is through its mobile money provision, M-PESA, in which the firm has heavily invested in. Originally, M-PESA started as a mobile money transfer businessman but has evolved to an all-around full-fledged financial service hub offering services such as M-Shwari for savings, credit, and insurance – M-PESA. This strategic investment in what arguably is a high-growth area has proved highly helpful to Safaricom’s flow of revenues and strategic market standing and thus added value to shareholders. 
•	Operational Excellence: Safaricom has massively invested in network infrastructure, hence enhancing service quality compared to its competitors, this is felt more in the rural and relatively un-serviced areas.

•	Superior Cash Flow: This has been realised through charges on its service such as M-PESA, voice and data where Safaricom has consistently provided and paid regular and growing dividends for its shareholders. Further, this strong cash flow has shored up significant financial bulwark that has enabled the firm to invest in new technologies and/or services without overusing debt as a financial tool, all of the while creating wealth for shareholders.

<br>
<br>
<br>
III.	Equity Group Holdings 
•	Disciplined Investment: Equity’s expansion into other countries such as Uganda, Tanzania and South Sudan was very sound strategies right, to penetrate new markets that had higher growth rates.

•	Industry-Leading Returns: The Company has consistently reported its operations’ financial performance with return on asset and equity result figures that are outcompeting all those of the industry average, thus, investor confidence. They have led to a consistent rise of the companies’ stock price and sound dividends, in return achieving shareholder value. 
•	Superior Cash Flow: The bank has had relatively good flows in the form of cash from the activities of the bank that has supported decent levels of liquidity that support both expansion and dividend payments.

QUESTION TWO<br>
a) <br>This evaluation will consider three companies on the Nairobi Securities Exchange that has to an extent been unable to increase shareholder value; this evaluation will undertake the exercise based on the four summarized components as illustrated in the figure above. 
 <br>
 <br>
 1. Kenya Airways Plc 
•	Disciplined Investment: In the course of this years, this Kenya Airways has undertaken some investment which have not given them the expected returns. For instance, it invested in such capacity as in fleets particularly the acquisition of Boeing 787 Dreamliners badly at the wrong time when demand for travel was plummeting and operating costs escalating. Owing to the weakness of discipline investment it has also compromised on the timing of its execution and overestimated demand that has brought unavoidable financial pressure and poor increments shareholders’ wealth. 
•	Operational Excellence: Some of the operational issues include several flight delays, ineffective and poor customer service and high operating costs against which many airlines have been unable to break even. Such inefficiencies have been recoiling on customer loyalty and have placed operational cost high, and in the process, the organizations keep on registering losses that are not good for shareholders. 
•	Industry-Leading Returns: Despite having low operation returns as compared to the general operation of aviation sectors, Kenya Airways has always been in such a state. Several years ago the company suffered several losses and it has not been in a position to generate incomes for the shareholders. It has resulted into loss of shareholder value in as much as stock prices are-headquartered and loss of investors’ confidence. 
•	Superior Cash Flow: The Company has recorded operating losses since high operating costs, high amount of debt and low amount of revenue have been recorded. This has been a problem of cash flow which made Kenya Airways limit in its investment in growth and dividend policies thus supporting the shareholder value. 
<br>
<br>
2. Mumias Sugar Company 
•	Disciplined Investment: Another source of expenditure for the Mumias Sugar Company they incurred a lot of expense on ethanol and electricity production in a bid to diversify their stream of income. However, these were not the best investments and as such the company did not gain the expected returns out of them. Strategic decisions have been wrong and strategic actions slow and clumsy resulting in no change in the shareholder value at all.
•	Operational Excellence: In fact, the Company has suffered many operational imperatives including it having old machineries, poor maintenance and frequent factory breakdowns. They have created issues of loss of production capacity and costs that cannot meet consumer needs, all of which have downplayed financial performance and less return on shareholders’ investment. 
•	Industry-Leading Returns: Mumias Sugar has not been in a position to post enhanced industry returns and for most of the periods, the company operates in the red. Because of high operation costs and problems in the supply chain the company has not been able to achieve good profitability Returns on investments have not been impressive and over the years the company has not been able to make good returns to its shareholders. . 
•	Superior Cash Flow: In the case therefore of the Company, the totals of cash flow have remained constrained or rather strictly controlled with the outflows far exceeding the inflows mainly because of poor sales, a huge amount due to its creditors and inefficiency. This cash constrained situation has occasioned the losses hence the inability to generate adequate operating cash flows and due to the same has caused a decline in shareholders’ value. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Uchumi Supermarkets Plc 
•	Disciplined Investment: Another poorly managed area was the strategy, of market expansion where uchumi supermarket opened other outlets in kenya and the EA region. Worse still, it overstretched itself in its resource deployment and as a result was faced with a cash flow crunch. There was also poor management of investment since there are no disciplined approach to investment for the growth of the organization and as such fail in the enhancement of shareholders’ value. 
•	Operational Excellence: Some of these operational challenges have for instance for instance seen Uchumi posting a major weakness in the areas of inventory controls, supply chain control, and a neability to price its products competitively. These operational inefficiencies were leading to stockouts, dissatisfied customers, and thus reduced sales which have annoying effects on the firm’s revenues and earnings and therefore on the shareholder value.
•	Industry-Leading Returns: Even on average the supermarket chain has performed extremely poorly in terms of generating returns than its industry counterparts. For the past several years the company has failed to post profits and is in deep losses on account of unmanageable and operational factors. These conditions of operation have not generated adequate earnings to pay returns to investors and as a result the company’s stock price has plummeted. 
•	Superior Cash Flow: Financial Management Uchumi has been in a poor position in terms of cash flow management and was unable to pay its suppliers, employees, and other expenses of operation. They have experienced a negative cash flow position occasioned by low sales revenues and high operating expenses, forced them to close more outlets and fail to meet financial commitments, thus leading to a big loss of shareholder worth.

b) <br>
<br>
<br>

•	Disciplined Investment: Absence of planning has also affected negatively the performance of KPLC in that they embarked on amping many projects with little or no serious thinking and the repercussions has been terrible: the laid down mechanisms are almost immobile most of the times and debts are accumulated. 
•	Operational Excellence: On one hand, this company feels the impact of this in as much as it has also been branded as having a similarly ‘scary’ perception of power imagery due to incessant power blackouts and irregular power supply with which it has been associated to. 
•	Industry-Leading Returns: This limited their mobility, meant that they were participating in providing inferior services thus making cost of operations and revenue unprofitable. 
•	Superior Cash Flow: Of the spectacles, there have been forgery and embezzlement, which have triggered the cash scarcity which is not good for the firm.

2. Mumias Sugar Co. Ltd 
•	Disciplined Investment: For Instance failure to maintain machineries that should have allowed the required investment; are among some of the vices that are inimical to production capacity.

3. Eveready East Africa Ltd

•	Operational Excellence: Other strategic mistakes inclusive of the over reliance on conventional products’ had become strategic hitches to operations. 
•	Industry-Leading Returns: This led to a nuclear of market share and profitability hence poor returns it was as a result of increased competition through cheaper imports. 
•	Superior Cash Flow: The net consequences of the decreased sales and the market share were poor cash flow and therefore the businesses had to be rationalized and some down sized.
